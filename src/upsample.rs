//! Chroma upsampling.
//!
//! # Which filter
//!
//! Horizontally, chroma in HEVC is left-sited: chroma sample `i` sits on luma
//! column `2i`. Even output columns are therefore a copy, and odd ones are the
//! average of the two neighbours — plain bilinear.
//!
//! Vertically, 4:2:0 chroma sits halfway between two luma rows, so the two
//! rows a chroma row feeds are a 3:1 blend of it and its neighbour. 4:2:2
//! needs no vertical work at all, and 4:4:4 needs none in either direction.
//!
//! This is a clean, cheap, standards-sited bilinear. It is not a windowed-sinc
//! or edge-directed upsampler; if that matters for your use it is the obvious
//! place to improve, and the filter is isolated here so that it can be.
//!
//! # Working a row at a time
//!
//! [`row`] expands one output row from the one or two chroma rows that feed
//! it, and is the only place the filter is written. [`plane`] is that function
//! run over every row into a full-resolution buffer; [`crate::color`] calls it
//! into a single reused row instead, so that a conversion never materialises a
//! full-resolution chroma plane. Both therefore produce bit-identical output.
