//! Where the crate decides whether to use more than one thread.
//!
//! Every threading decision is made here, so that the decoding code above it
//! reads the same whether or not the `parallel` feature is on and whether or
//! not the caller asked for a thread count. Two rules hold in both builds:
//!
//! * the output is identical — parallelism only changes *when* a sample is
//!   computed, never what it is, because every unit of work below writes to a
//!   disjoint region;
//! * `threads: Some(1)` runs the serial code itself, not a one-worker pool,
//!   so that "turn it off" and "build without the feature" are the same path.
